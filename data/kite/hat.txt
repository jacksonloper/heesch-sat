# Polykite Hat (Einstein Aperiodic Monotile)
#
# The "hat" is the famous aperiodic monotile discovered by Smith, Myers, Kaplan,
# and Goodman-Strauss in 2023. It consists of 8 congruent kites (60°-90°-120°-90°)
# arranged in a specific pattern that tiles the plane only aperiodically.
#
# Key properties of the hat:
# - 8 kites total
# - 14 boundary edges (14-sided polygon)
# - Simply connected (no holes)
# - Cannot tile the plane periodically (aperiodic)
# - Causes memory exhaustion in SAT-based tiling solvers due to exponential
#   growth of the search space (no periodic solution exists)
#
# This file contains the hat's coordinates in the heesch-sat kite grid
# coordinate system. The coordinates were identified by:
# 1. Finding all simply connected 8-kite polykites with exactly 14 boundary edges
# 2. Testing each with the SAT solver
# 3. Identifying the unique shape that exhausts solver memory (characteristic
#    of aperiodic tilers, as the solver searches for a periodic solution
#    that doesn't exist)
#
# Note: The SAT solver in heesch-sat is designed to detect isohedral/periodic 
# tilings. For the hat, the solver will run out of memory before finding a
# solution, since no periodic tiling exists. This behavior confirms the hat's
# aperiodic nature.
